## 📋 TASK 4: Backend Integration Backdoors

### What Are "Backdoors"?

In software architecture, "backdoors" (or "hooks") are **placeholder integration points** that allow future features to be plugged in without major refactoring.

Think of them as:
- 🔌 **Plugin sockets** - Ready to connect future services
- 🎯 **Extension points** - Places where new functionality can be added
- 🏗️ **Future-proof architecture** - Designed for growth

---

## 🎯 Goals for TASK 4

Based on your original request, here's what I understand you want:

### 1. **API Integration Backdoors**
Prepare the app to connect to backend APIs without breaking existing code:
- User authentication endpoints
- Design save/load endpoints
- 3D model storage endpoints
- Image upload endpoints
- Export service endpoints

### 2. **State Management Backdoors**
Set up state management to handle server data:
- User session state
- Design cloud sync state
- Real-time collaboration state
- Offline/online state

### 3. **Service Layer Backdoors**
Create service interfaces that can be swapped:
- Mock services (for development)
- Real API services (for production)
- Offline-first services (for PWA)

### 4. **Feature Flag Backdoors**
Enable/disable features remotely:
- Beta features
- Premium features
- Platform-specific features
- A/B testing features

## 🤔 Questions Before We Start

To build the right backdoors, I need to understand your backend plans:

### **Question 1: Backend Technology**
What backend are you planning to use?
- [ ] **Supabase** (recommended - easy, fast, free tier)
- [ ] **Firebase** (Google's platform)
- [ ] **Custom Node.js/Express API**
- [ ] **Custom Python/Django API**
- [ ] **Other:** _____________
- [ ] **Not decided yet** (I'll design for flexibility)

### **Question 2: Authentication**
What authentication method?
- [ ] **Email/Password**
- [ ] **Social Login** (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- [ ] **Magic Link** (passwordless)
- [ ] **Phone/SMS**
- [ ] **All of the above**
- [ ] **Not decided yet**

### **Question 3: Data Storage**
Where will designs be stored?
- [ ] **Cloud database** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] **Local storage only** (AsyncStorage)
- [ ] **Hybrid** (local + cloud sync)
- [ ] **Not decided yet**

### **Question 4: Real-time Features**
Do you need real-time collaboration?
- [ ] **Yes** - Multiple users editing same design
- [ ] **No** - Single user only
- [ ] **Maybe later**

### **Question 5: File Storage**
Where will images/3D models be stored?
- [ ] **Cloud storage** (S3, Cloudinary, Supabase Storage)
- [ ] **Local device only**
- [ ] **Hybrid**
- [ ] **Not decided yet**

### **Question 6: Offline Support**
Should the app work offline?
- [ ] **Yes** - Full offline mode with sync
- [ ] **Partial** - View only offline
- [ ] **No** - Online only
- [ ] **Not decided yet**

### **Question 7: Premium Features**
Will you have paid features?
- [ ] **Yes** - Need payment integration
- [ ] **No** - Free app only
- [ ] **Maybe later**

## 💡 My Recommendations

Based on your app's needs, here's what I recommend:

### **Recommended Stack:**

**Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Real-time)
- ✅ Free tier (generous limits)
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ✅ Built-in file storage
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions
- ✅ Row-level security
- ✅ Easy to set up
- ✅ Great for React Native

**State Management:** Zustand (already in package.json)
- ✅ Simple and lightweight
- ✅ No boilerplate
- ✅ Great TypeScript support
- ✅ Easy to test

**Offline Support:** React Query + AsyncStorage
- ✅ Automatic caching
- ✅ Background sync
- ✅ Optimistic updates
- ✅ Retry logic

**File Upload:** Supabase Storage + Image optimization
- ✅ CDN delivery
- ✅ Automatic image transformations
- ✅ Access control

## 🏗️ Proposed Architecture

Here's what I propose to build:

### **1. Service Layer Structure**
```
src/core/services/
├── api/
│   ├── client.js              # API client (Axios/Fetch wrapper)
│   ├── auth.api.js            # Authentication endpoints
│   ├── designs.api.js         # Design CRUD endpoints
│   ├── models.api.js          # 3D model endpoints
│   ├── images.api.js          # Image upload endpoints
│   └── user.api.js            # User profile endpoints
├── storage/
│   ├── local.storage.js       # AsyncStorage wrapper
│   ├── cloud.storage.js       # Cloud storage wrapper
│   └── sync.service.js        # Sync service
└── config/
    ├── api.config.js          # API configuration
    ├── env.config.js          # Environment variables
    └── features.config.js     # Feature flags
```

### **2. State Management Structure**
```
src/core/state/
├── stores/
│   ├── authStore.js           # User authentication state
│   ├── designStore.js         # Design data (already exists)
│   ├── syncStore.js           # Sync status state
│   └── uiStore.js             # UI state (modals, loading, etc.)
└── hooks/
    ├── useAuth.js             # Authentication hook
    ├── useDesigns.js          # Designs CRUD hook
    ├── useSync.js             # Sync status hook
    └── useUpload.js           # File upload hook
```

### **3. Environment Configuration**
```
.env.example                   # Template
.env.development              # Dev config
.env.production               # Prod config
```

### **4. Feature Flags**
```javascript
// src/core/config/features.config.js
export const FEATURES = {
  AUTH: {
    ENABLED: true,
    SOCIAL_LOGIN: false,      // Backdoor for future
    MAGIC_LINK: false,        // Backdoor for future
  },
  CLOUD_SYNC: {
    ENABLED: false,           // Backdoor - enable when ready
    AUTO_SYNC: true,
    SYNC_INTERVAL: 30000,
  },
  COLLABORATION: {
    ENABLED: false,           // Backdoor for future
    REAL_TIME: false,
  },
  PREMIUM: {
    ENABLED: false,           // Backdoor for future
    FEATURES: [],
  },
  EXPORT: {
    PNG: true,
    SVG: true,
    PDF: true,
    GLTF: false,              // Backdoor for 3D export
  },
};
```

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Once you answer the questions above, I'll:
